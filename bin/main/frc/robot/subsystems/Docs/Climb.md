Climb Subsystem
=====

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Climb subsystem is for climbing up onto the different levels of the habitat in the 2019 game. The subsystem uses a 2 stage piston.

### Mechanism Info

<p> The mechanism will use a two stage piston system, with 2 pistons on either side of the robot. The pistons will be accessed by using only one object and splitting the air flow. The pistons work by first firing the lower 2, and then firing the top two. After that, the motor will be used to propel the robot forward in order to finish the climb onto the habitat level. </p>
