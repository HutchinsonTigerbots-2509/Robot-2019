 General Subsystem ReadMe
======

Subsystems are the smaller collections of components that make up the robot. They will contain physical objects like motors and pistons, but also virtual data like varibles. These are grouped together in a single class, so they can be used and accessed throughout the code. Below are the individual subsystems and a link to their more specific docs.
